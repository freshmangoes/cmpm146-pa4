IDLE/Spread strategy

Check values of planet cost and distance
    Figure out top 5 lowest values within arbitrary distance
        If planets of those checked are enemy planets or not
            Prioritize enemy planets with check for distance and growth at their planet,
            amount of turns it will take us to get there, the current fleet count
        Else
            take over closest neutral planet with (fleet + 1) FOR NOW


NAME THIS STRATEGY - Aggressive Expansion?
After arbitrary number of fleets we already have 
	Check if planet is theirs or ours
		prioritize neutral
			prioritize largest value
	Probably make IDLe/spread strategy a child of this so that starts expansion again


Defensive?
Figure out planet being targeted
	Check enemy fleet count currently in flight
		Check our fleet count at planet and growth rate
			If we have planet close enough to reinforce --> do
				Unless it will have low fleet count and be susceptible to attacks or 



if growth * fleet flight distance > fleet being sent for reinforcements --> don't do
